If Junior Engineers miss a workshop more than 2 times without advance notice or reasonable cause, they’ll be unable to receive full points for completing the program. Reasonable causes for not attending workshops are either a) an immovable conflict during the time of the workshop or b) sickness/serious personal matters.\nThose who have permanent scheduling conflicts during the time of the workshop must notify the division leads when the training program starts, and can attend workshops asynchronously via recordings.\nDuring any missed workshop, the Junior Engineer must read the slides for that week and fill out the AITP Makeup Form on the technical content which will be a Google Form posted on Slack."

If a Junior Engineer is inactive for a sufficient period of time, they will be removed from their project team and AITP for that semester. At the end of the project there will be a peer evaluation of group contribution. Those who do not demonstrate meaningful contribution to the project group will not be able to receive the AITP certification.\nSuccessfully complete final deliverables Final presentation Attend final poster presentation Junior Engineers will present their work to the rest of DAML, faculty members & (potentially) recruiters at a end-of-semester project showcase Attendance is mandatory (unless there’s an immovable conflict) in order to receive credit for the project Pass a final exam Junior Engineers will complete a short final exam on AITP material A weighted score on both the exam and presentation will be calculated to determine placements into DAML Senior Engineer positions. In general, Junior Engineers who consistently attend AITP workshops every week and work 1-2 hours on their team project tend to become Senior Engineers."
